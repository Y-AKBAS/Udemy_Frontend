    The <b>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
    Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl,
    Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] <b>Rooster</b> and <b>cock</b> are terms for adult male birds, and a
    younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a
    hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
    (consuming both
    their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in
    some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and literature.
